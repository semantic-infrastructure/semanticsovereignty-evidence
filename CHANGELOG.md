**Domain:** semanticsovereignty.com  
**Repository:** semanticsovereignty-evidence  
**Versioning scheme:** semantic (vX.Y)

---

## v1.0 — 2026-01-19

### Added
- Public reference page (`index.html`) describing semantic sovereignty and governance scope
- Evidence repository baseline:
  - `README.md` (purpose, scope overview, repository discipline)
  - `SCOPE.md` (included and excluded governance boundaries)
  - `SOURCES.md` (primary and context source anchors)
  - `MODEL.md` (Canonical Meaning Control reference model)
  - `MAPS/term-governance-mapping.md` (operational governance mapping)

### Scope
- Defined semantic sovereignty as governance of canonical meaning, not interpretation or enforcement
- Explicit exclusion of political, legal, and ideological language claims

### Model
- Introduced the CMC model with three layers:
  - Term Authority
  - Definition Boundary
  - Change Discipline

### Sources
- Anchored governance concepts in W3C semantic web standards and vocabulary governance practices

### Constraints
- Enforced explicit versioning, deprecation, and migration discipline
- Prohibited silent semantic changes and popularity-based authority inference

## Versioning policy

- Minor versions (`v1.1`, `v1.2`, …) document:
  - scope clarifications,
  - additional source anchors,
  - mapping refinements.

- Major versions (`v2.0`, …) indicate:
  - fundamental model changes,
  - scope redefinition.

All changes are additive or explicitly deprecated; no silent removals.
