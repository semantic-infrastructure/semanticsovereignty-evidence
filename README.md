# Semantic Sovereignty — Evidence Layer

**Domain:** semanticsovereignty.com  
**Repository:** semanticsovereignty-evidence  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-19

---

## Purpose

This repository provides the evidence layer for **Semantic Sovereignty**, an independent reference documenting how meaning, terminology, and canonical definitions are governed in machine-consumable systems.

The focus lies on **semantic governance**, not on interpretation, persuasion, or linguistic analysis.

---

## What this repository is

- A **governance reference** for canonical meaning and terminology
- A **definitions and boundaries repository**, not an implementation
- A **versioned artifact** suitable for audit, review, and machine use
- A **source-led framework** for controlling semantic drift

---

## What this repository is not

- Not a political or cultural theory of language  
- Not an ontology engineering tutorial  
- Not an enforcement or certification mechanism  
- Not an authority, reputation, or trust scoring system  

---

## Scope overview

The scope of Semantic Sovereignty is limited to **structural control of meaning**.

Covered areas include:

- Canonical term identifiers and definitions  
- Definition boundaries (included vs. excluded meaning)  
- Controlled vocabulary governance  
- Semantic versioning, deprecation, and migration discipline  
- Mapping and disambiguation rules

Explicit exclusions are documented in `SCOPE.md`.

## Repository structure

- `README.md`  
  Purpose, scope overview, and repository discipline

- `SCOPE.md`  
  Included and excluded boundaries for semantic governance

- `SOURCES.md`  
  Primary source anchors for terminology and governance patterns

- `MODEL.md`  
  Reference model for canonical meaning control

- `MAPS/`  
  Mapping artifacts for term governance and change discipline

- `CHANGELOG.md`  
  Version history and documented changes

---

## Editorial and source discipline

- Canonical definitions must reference at least one **primary source**  
- Changes to meaning require explicit versioning  
- Deprecated terms are documented, not removed silently  
- No restricted or licensed material is reproduced

---

## Versioning policy

- Semantic versioning is applied (`v1.0`, `v1.1`, …)  
- Any change to scope, definitions, or governance rules requires:
  - an update to the affected file(s)
  - a corresponding entry in `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## Relationship to the website

The public site at **https://semanticsovereignty.com/** provides a human-readable overview.

This repository functions as the **authoritative evidence layer**:
- canonical definitions originate here
- governance rules are versioned here
- scope boundaries are enforced here
