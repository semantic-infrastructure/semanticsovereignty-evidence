## Scope statement

Semantic Sovereignty documents **governance of meaning** in machine-consumable systems.
The scope is limited to how terms, definitions, and vocabularies are **canonically defined,
versioned, constrained, and changed** over time.

This scope is structural and procedural.  
It does not evaluate truth, correctness, or linguistic interpretation.

---

## Included

- **Canonical term identifiers**  
  Stable identifiers for concepts and terms, including ownership and publication context.

- **Definition boundaries**  
  Explicit statements of what a term includes and excludes.

- **Controlled vocabularies**  
  Governance of term sets, preferred labels, alternate labels, and disambiguation.

- **Semantic versioning**  
  Versioning, deprecation, replacement, and migration of meanings.

- **Change discipline**  
  Documented processes for modifying definitions and vocabularies over time.

- **Mapping rules**  
  Relationships between terms (e.g., synonymy, near-synonymy, replacement).

---

## Excluded

- **Natural language interpretation**  
  Meaning inference, sentiment analysis, or contextual understanding.

- **Authority or trust scoring**  
  Any ranking or evaluation of meaning quality or correctness.

- **Legal or jurisdictional claims**  
  No assertions of legal sovereignty, ownership, or enforceability.

- **Political, cultural, or ideological frameworks**  
  No normative or societal arguments about language or power.

---

## Boundary clarifications

- **Semantic sovereignty** refers to *control over definition and change*, not control over usage.  
- **Governance** refers to *process and discipline*, not enforcement or policing.  
- **Canonical** refers to *published reference status*, not correctness or endorsement.

---

## Terminology baseline

Terminology and governance concepts align with established semantic web and vocabulary standards.
Primary anchors and governance references are documented in `SOURCES.md`.

---

## Change control

Any modification to this scope requires:
- an explicit update to this file, and
- a corresponding entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.

Scope elements are deprecated explicitly and are not removed without record.
