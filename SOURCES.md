## Context sources (non-anchor)

Context sources may be cited for explanatory background.
They do **not** replace primary anchors.

## Citation discipline

- Canonical definitions must reference at least one **primary source**.  
- Context sources may explain practice but must not redefine terms.  
- No restricted or paywalled text is reproduced.  
- URLs are chosen for **stability and canonical status**.
